# SUNDIALS CVODE

The sundials-cvode template provides a network integration program and ancillary modules for solving a general reaction network with constant temperature. It uses the SUNDIALS cvode integrator in stiff BDF mode with a user supplied jacobian. Developed and tested with sundials v. 2.6.2.

Plotting functionality is provided by the python scripts plot_rates.py and plot_abundances.py. Additional python scripts are provided for sanity checks and table introspection.
